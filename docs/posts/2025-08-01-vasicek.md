## Vasicek in Basel

In a nutshell, if God gives us the probability of default of an obligor, the loss when defaults occur, and the exposure of this obligor, we can calculate the expected value of the loss by multiplying the three factors.

Basel minimum capital requirement per unit of exposure is  

the new probablity of default given that the systematic source of the asset value has been as low as the 0.001 quantile.  

$$
\Phi(\frac{\Phi^{-1}(PD)+\sqrt{\rho}\Phi^{-1}(0.999)}{\sqrt{1-\rho}})  
$$

The underlying probabilistic model is the one factor model. 

$$
Y_i = \sqrt{\rho} X + \sqrt{1-\rho} \epsilon_i
$$

where $Y_i,X,\epsilon_i$ are independent standard Gaussian variables, with $Y_i$ detnoing the value of i-th asset, $X$ the common factor having an impact on all asset values, and $\epsilon_i$ the individual factor that impacts only the asset i. The above formula is computing the conditional probability of default 

$$
P[Y_i<\Phi^{-1}(PD)| X = x] 
$$

with $x = \Phi^{-1}(0.001)$. 

Here the assumption is that the common factor has a correlation $\rho$ with the asset i across the board. 


The remaining modelling task it to figure out the risk parameters in this formula
