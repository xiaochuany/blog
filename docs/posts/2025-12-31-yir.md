# 2026 Resolution
 
## outlive plan per Attia's book

| Day | Protocol | Intensity / Metric | “Outlive” Rationale |
|-----|----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Mon | Strength (Lower) | 1.5 × Bodyweight Squat (Target) | Leg strength is the #1 predictor of stability in old age. |
| Tue | Zone 2 Run | 45–60 min @ ~7:15 min/km | Builds mitochondrial density to prevent Type 2 Diabetes. |
| Wed | Strength (Upper) | 2 min Dead Hang / Max Pushups | Grip strength is a highly correlated proxy for brain health. |
| Thu | Zone 2 Run | 45–60 min @ ~7:15 min/km | Trains your body to oxidize fat rather than just glucose. |
| Fri | VO₂ Max (4×4) | 4 min Hard / 4 min Easy (×4) | Moving from 25th to 95th percentile = ~5× mortality risk reduction. |
| Sat | Long Ruck / Run | 90 min Zone 2 (with 10–15 kg pack) | Rucking builds “Chassis” (bone density) and “Engine” simultaneously. |
| Sun | Stability | 20 min DNS / Balance Drills | Prevents the “Final Fall”: 50% of 80-year-olds die within a year of a hip fracture. |
