# Build a mortgate calculator with fasthtml

There are app frameworks out there for domain experts to easily get started with app buiding, e.g. `streamlit` for data scientists. 

A possible downside of these approaches is the lack of flexibility and scalability. [`fasthtml`](https://www.fastht.ml/) is a new python framework that is flexible and,  from what I read, pretty scalable too. It provides a unified python interface that maps 1-to-1 to http, html, css and htmx for interactivity. This guarantees flexibility without without unnecessary abstractions and client side logic. Also the code often looks pretty neat, therefore pretty temping for new users to get started by copy-pasting some basic examples from their repo. 

That said, if a new user does not have any knowledge of the web (http, how anchor/form tags work, client-server communication, htmx attributes), there are things to learn before they can make sense of the framework. But these concepts of the web are worth learning anyway for someone building a web app, so the time invested in the learning is not wasted.  

Here is a toy example.

![alt text](assets/image.png)

The whole app is one python file with 20 lines of code (see below). Features highlighted: 

- html tags are python object.
- router and function names map to  url and http methods.
- htmx for (server centric) interactivity, avoiding writing (too much) javascript. 
- by default picocss is used for styling (it can be swapped by tailwind, or customized css/ no styling at all)

```py
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt = fast_app(pico=True) # default True

@rt("/")
def get():
    return Titled("mortgate calculator", 
        Grid(
            Input(type="number", placeholder="Loan Amount", id="P"),
            Input(type="number", placeholder="Interest rate (per cent)", id="r"),
            Input(type="number", placeholder="Loan Term (months)", id="n"),
            Button("Calculate", target_id="result", hx_put="/calculate", hx_include="#P,#r,#n"),),
        Div(id="result")
    )

@rt("/calculate")
def put(P:float,r:float,n:int):
    r= r/ 100 / 12
    m = P*r*(1+r)**n / ((1+r)**n - 1)
    return Details(
        Summary(H3(f"monthly payment {m:.2f}")), 
        Ul(Li(f"interest payment {P*r:.2f}"), Li(f"principle payment {m-P*r:.2f}")),
        open=True)

serve()
```

No form element is used because *any* html element is allowed (via htmx) to trigger HTTP requests. The payload picks up the values of the ids mentioned in `hx_include` attribute (equivalent to using a form which wraps the inputs and button).
