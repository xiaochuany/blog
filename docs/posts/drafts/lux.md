# Just enough Luxembourgish

I've lived in Luxembourg for a few years now. Other than  "moien" and "addi", I know nothing about the language. 
This post is me forcing myself to start learning after having dropped out of a Luxembourgish class and wasted hundreds of euros on the class and learning material. 

My goal is not to become bilingual or anything like that. I want to pass the threshold of beginner to be able to read signs on the street and strike a basic conversation with a local, and not more (at least for now).

It is not an easy language. I will keep adding/revising contents in this post which I absolutely don't want to forget.

## I am ...

> "Ech sinn" means "I am" (je suis).  
> "Du bass" means "You are" (tu es).  
> "Si ass" means "She is" (elle est).  
> "Hien ass" means "He is" (il est).  

> "Dir sidd" means "You are" (vous Ãªtes, same as French, also singular formal).  
> "Mir sinn" means "We are" (nous sommes).  
> "Si sinn" means "They are" (ils sont).  


## We are friends

> Esch sinn den Thibault   
> Si ass d'Eva  
> Mir sinn Fr&euml;nn

Notice there are no articles in case of plural.
