# Cheatsheet on financial terms

## balance sheet

The balance sheet roughly describes the incoming (liabilities) and outcoming (assets) cashflow of a financial institution. Assets are what institutions invest. Liabilities are source of the financing for the investment made. The rest is called equity (assets - liabilities). An institution is solvent if the equity is postive. 

## capital

Equity is sometimes called shareholder's capital. 

Capital is also used in regulatory capital  (set by regulators as minimal requirements for the continuation of the business, ranked by tiers, linked to risk weighted assets) and the economic capital (quantile of the loss distribution, modeled internally by institutions for capital allocation, performance measurement). 

## fixed income products

Refers to goverment/corporate/municipal bonds, mortgage based securities, certificate of deposits, short term debt securities ...


## yield

Used to measure the return of the bonds.
Having observed all the variables other than $Y$, solve the eqution:

$$
P = \sum_{t=1}^{n \times k} \left[ \frac{C/k}{(1 + Y/k)^t} \right] + \frac{F}{(1 + Y/k)^{n \times k}}
$$

Here $P$ is the current market price, C the coupon paid $k$ times per year for the remaining $n$ years, $F$ the face value. 

We see that $Y$ is essentially an averaged interest rate for the remaining duration of the bond.


## yield curve

A yield curve is a graph that plots the yields to maturity of bonds that have equal credit quality but different maturity dates, at a specific point in time.

It is is obtained by solving the yield equation above with a collection of inputs $(P_i, n_i, F_i, C_i)$.
