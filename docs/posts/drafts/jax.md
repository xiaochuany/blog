# Computing with `jax`

!!! abstract
    Mutiple packages came to solve the speed issue of `python` in scientific computing. The de facto standard is of course `numpy`. Think also `numba`, `jax`, `torch` or even a new language :fire: that go beyond what `numpy` offers.  This post is a quick intro to my personal preference as of Jan 2025. 


## Numpy operations

The part of `jax` that's straightforward to use for `numpy` users is the `jax.numpy` module, which has the identical API. Like other parts of `jax`, these operations are built on top of the XLA compiler for high performance numerical computations. 

## Random numbers 

Be aware that `jax` follows the functional programming paradigm. This means explicit key handling for samplers. The samplers can be composed with `vmap` to achieve vectorization
across all parameters, e.g. `random.t` has two parameters (key and df), one can supply two arrays to the `vmap(random.t)`. 


```py exec="on" result="text" source="above"
--8<-- "jx.py:random"
```

Notice that we turn the subkeys (list) into array because `jax` expects array for vectorized functions. 

See details in the [official docs](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.random.html#module-jax.random). 

## `vmap`

More control over the operating axes of `vmap` is possible. Here `in_axes=(0,None)` imposes that the vectorization occurs in the first argument of the function, and the batch axis is axis 0. Without specifying `in_axes`, the `vmap(f)` would expect its arguments to be
arrays of rank (at least) 1 and containing the same number of elements once unpacked, which is not the case for our inputs.  

Notice that broadcasting Ã  la numpy is performed for the base function (before vmap). The effect of vmap is `np.stack` 
individual results of the function along the new out_axes (in this example the columns). Using `vmap` can avoid  manual batching, manual stacking etc.  

```py exec="on" result="text" source="above"
--8<-- "jx.py:vmap"
```
