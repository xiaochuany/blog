## random reddit person's calculation for ETF vs Pension saving plan

conclusion is basically that ETF index tracking funds is better than any of the pension plan out there

assume performance are equal

- pension funds have a higher fee
- 50% of the income tax rate on exit
- no tax on ETF provided holding > 6 months
- but there is tax on dividend for ETF

example: 

- 1.5 percent fee vs 0
- 0.5 * tax bracket on exit vs  yearly tax on dividend

plugging assumptions on the tax bracket and divident to reach a conclusion. 

TODO: build an app for this calculation
