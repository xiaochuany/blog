# FRM learning objectives

The exam asks for a few simple calculations in basic arithmetic, applied to the ideas. You may need to compute R2 from three sums of squares, given their values. People who always rely on software may stumble, but the work is easy.  

Within a singple topic, the exam focus on how concepts are related, in which scenario and how each concept is used, for which kind of applications. You may need to know how R2 and correlation are connected in linear regression.
