# Welch t test
<!-- more -->

in case where the population variance $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ are unknown and may be different, the test statistic is 

$$
t = \frac{\bar X_1 - \bar X_2}{\sqrt{\hat \sigma_1^2/n + \hat\sigma_2^2/m}}
$$

where $n,m$ are the size of the two samples. 


In such case the distribution of the t statistic is not a student t distribution. Rather it depends on the unknown variances.

Recall that we  have 
$$
\hat\sigma_i^2 /\sigma_i^2 = \chi^2_{n_i-1}/(n_i-1) =: W_i
$$
where $i\in\{1,2\}$ and $n_1=n, n_2=m$. Hence, 

$$
t = \frac{\bar X_1 - \bar X_2}{\sqrt{W_1\sigma_1^2/n + W_2\sigma_2^2/m}}\\
= \frac{N(0,1)}{\sqrt{W_1 a + W_2 (1-a) }}
$$

where $a = \frac{\sigma_1^2/n}{\sigma_1^2/n + \sigma_2^2/m}$. Depending on the value of variances, this coefficient can be as close to 0 or 1 as possible. 

The quantity in the square root interpolates between two scaled chisquare distributions, with two extremal points be exactly Student t distributed.
