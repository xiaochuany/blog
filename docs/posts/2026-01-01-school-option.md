## caveat

enrolling a child for school outside of the commune of residence is possible in three cases

- public international by dossier e.g. EIGT, LML
- private does not care about residence 
- The case of public luxembourgish requires more work. Check "Enrolling in a different State-run school in the commune of residence, or in a State-run school in another commune" section in the [page](https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/famille-education/enseignement-fondamental/inscription/inscription-enseignement-fondamental.html)

NOTE: both parents work in Luxembourg city is not good enough of a reason!
