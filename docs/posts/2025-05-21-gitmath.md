# Repurposing gitHub for mathematical research
<!-- more -->
*courtesy: Claude*

[Marin project](https://marin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) triggers my interest to repurpose github as a tool for open and reproducible mathematical research. Below is an example of how this can work, mostly one-shot generated by Claude.  

## Basic Repository Structure

```
conjecture-name/
├── README.md         # Overview, current status, and roadmap
├── conjecture.md     # Formal statement and background
├── proofs/           # Your proof attempts and progress
├── simulations/      # Code for experimental verification
└── notes/            # Working thoughts and observations
```

## Simple Workflow

### 1. Setup & Problem Definition

- Create the repository with a clear README explaining your goal
- Write `conjecture.md` with the formal statement, notation, and known related results
- Set up an initial project board with basic columns: "Ideas", "In Progress", "Needs Review", "Completed"

### 2. Working Process Using Issues

- **Create issues for specific approaches**: "Approach via induction", "Probabilistic method attempt"
- **Create issues for subproblems**: "Prove special case when n=2", "Find counterexample for condition X"
- Use issue descriptions to outline your thinking process
- Reference mathematical literature with links or DOIs
- Close issues when an approach proves unsuccessful (with notes on why)

### 3. Exploration via Branches

- Create a new branch for each significant approach (`inductive-approach`, `computational-verification`)
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages that explain your mathematical thinking
- Use commit messages to document insights: "Realized lemma fails when x approaches infinity"

### 4. Documentation Using Pull Requests

When you make meaningful progress:
- Open a PR from your working branch to main
- Write a detailed description of your findings
- **Self-review your work** by reading through changes with fresh eyes
- Merge when you're confident in the correctness

### 5. Simulation & Verification

- Place code in the `simulations/` directory
- Document computational experiments in PR descriptions
- Link simulation results to theoretical approaches

### 6. Progress Tracking

- Use GitHub milestones to mark significant achievements ("Special case proven", "Main lemma established")
- Update the README regularly with current status
- Pin important issues that represent active lines of inquiry

## Key GitHub Features to Leverage

### **Issues** - Use as mathematical questions, approaches, or subproblems
   - Add labels like "promising", "stuck", "counterexample"
   - Reference equations with LaTeX in Markdown: `$E = mc^2$`

### **Project Board** - Visual organization of your research flow
   - Track which approaches are active
   - See what needs verification

### **PR Process** - Even as a solo researcher, use PRs as checkpoints
   - Force yourself to clearly articulate progress
   - Create a record of major developments
   - Serve as a self-review mechanism

### **Discussions** - For longer-form mathematical exploration
   - Work through complex ideas
   - Record insights that don't fit elsewhere
