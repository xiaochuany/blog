check more carefully, about performance based bonus from employer, exempt or moderate?

if the funds pay officially a divident. then the divident should be part of the taxable income with normal rate.

otherwise, the funds manager reinvest all the gains into the shares of the gain. no tax incurred. 

at sell time, if hold investment for longer than 6 months, no tax on the gain from the investment.
