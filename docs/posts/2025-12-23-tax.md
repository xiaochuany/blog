# LIR 

<!-- more -->
## breakdown taxable income

cashflow point of view: 

- gets gross income +
- pays social security -
- pays travel expenses -
- pays professional training or purchases (lump sum 540) -

nuances about the gross income 

- to keep: normal  
- to exempt: overtime, ... 
- to moderate: extraordinary income such as backpays, big bonus, sell a property (half / quarter of the standard rate) 

check more carefully, about performance based bonus from employer, exempt or moderate? 

## gain from investment in funds 

if the funds pay officially a divident. then the divident should be part of the taxable income with normal rate.

otherwise, the funds manager reinvest all the gains into the shares of the gain. no tax incurred. 

at sell time, if hold investment for longer than 6 months, no tax on the gain from the investment.  

## special expenses

# Special deductible expenses covered by the lump-sum deduction (Form 100)

This note explains each item shown in the Form 100 online section **“Special deductible expenses covered by the lump-sum deduction”**, with references to the **Luxembourg Income Tax Law (LIR)**.
Logic first, details second.

## What this section really means

* Luxembourg grants a **forfait (lump‑sum) deduction** for certain *special expenses* (dépenses spéciales).
* If your **actual expenses ≤ forfait**, you **do nothing** (just answer *Yes/No* to indicate existence).
* If **actual expenses > forfait**, you later **opt for itemisation** and declare amounts elsewhere.

Mathematically:
[ \text{Deduction} = \max(\text{forfait}, \sum \text{actual eligible expenses}) ]

This screen only determines **eligibility buckets**, not amounts.

* Salaried employee with no complex situation → **answer Yes where applicable, don’t itemise**.
* Large 3rd pillar / home savings / donations → **itemisation beats forfait**.

If you want, I can compress this into a **decision table** or map it exactly to **Form 100 line numbers**.
