# LIR 

<!-- more -->
## breakdown taxable income

cashflow point of view: 

- gets gross income +
- pays social security -
- pays travel expenses -
- pays professional training or purchases (lump sum 540) -

nuances about the gross income 

- to keep: normal  
- to exempt: overtime, ... 
- to moderate: extraordinary income such as backpays, big bonus, sell a property (half / quarter of the standard rate) 

check more carefully, about performance based bonus from employer, exempt or moderate? 

## gain from investment in funds 

if the funds pay officially a divident. then the divident should be part of the taxable income with normal rate.

otherwise, the funds manager reinvest all the gains into the shares of the gain. no tax incurred. 

at sell time, if hold investment for longer than 6 months, no tax on the gain from the investment.  

## special expenses

# Special deductible expenses covered by the lump-sum deduction (Form 100)

This note explains each item shown in the Form 100 online section **“Special deductible expenses covered by the lump-sum deduction”**, with references to the **Luxembourg Income Tax Law (LIR)**.
Logic first, details second.

---

## What this section really means

* Luxembourg grants a **forfait (lump‑sum) deduction** for certain *special expenses* (dépenses spéciales).
* If your **actual expenses ≤ forfait**, you **do nothing** (just answer *Yes/No* to indicate existence).
* If **actual expenses > forfait**, you later **opt for itemisation** and declare amounts elsewhere.

Mathematically:
[ \text{Deduction} = \max(\text{forfait}, \sum \text{actual eligible expenses}) ]

This screen only determines **eligibility buckets**, not amounts.

---

## Practical rule of thumb

* Salaried employee with no complex situation → **answer Yes where applicable, don’t itemise**.
* Large 3rd pillar / home savings / donations → **itemisation beats forfait**.

If you want, I can compress this into a **decision table** or map it exactly to **Form 100 line numbers**.


# Extraordinary expenses (Form 100) — with a dependent child in the household

This note explains the **“Extraordinary expenses”** section of Form 100, with references to the **Luxembourg Income Tax Law (LIR)** and Grand-Ducal regulations, **explicitly taking into account that you have one dependent child in your household**.

This category is conceptually different from *special expenses*: it is **ability-to-pay based**, not forfait-driven.

---

## Core idea (don’t skip)

Extraordinary expenses are deductible **only if** they:

1. Are **unavoidable** (objectively necessary), and
2. **Substantially reduce your ability to pay tax**.

Formally (Art. 127 LIR):
[
\text{Extraordinary expense} \iff E \text{ unavoidable } \land E / Y \text{ materially large}
]
where (Y) = taxable capacity.

Having a **dependent child lowers the tolerance threshold** at which an expense is considered “extraordinary”.

---

## 1. Individual request for reduction due to extraordinary expenses

**(Article 127 LIR)**

**Form wording**

> Request for a reduction in taxable income due to extraordinary expenses which are unavoidable and which substantially reduce the taxpayer's ability to pay

**What this is**
A **case-by-case assessment** by the tax office.

**Typical expenses**

* Exceptional medical costs (not reimbursed)
* Heavy care costs for a child or spouse
* Disability-related equipment not covered elsewhere

**Role of the dependent child**

* Family size (number of children) is explicitly considered when judging “substantial reduction”
* Same expense → **more likely deductible** with a child than without

**LIR reference**

* **Art. 127 LIR**

**Practical insight**
This is the *most flexible* but also *most evidence-heavy* route.

---

## 2. Flat-rate reduction due to disability or infirmity

**(Grand Ducal Regulation of 7 March 1969, as amended)**

**What this is**
A **forfait deduction** granted if the taxpayer or a dependent suffers from a recognised disability or infirmity.

**Tax treatment**

* No proof of actual expenses required
* Amount depends on degree of disability

**With a dependent child**

* Applies **if the child is disabled**, even if parents are not
* Child must be fiscally dependent

**Legal basis**

* **Art. 127 LIR**
* **GD Regulation 07.03.1969**

**Binary choice**
Forfait **or** actual expenses under Art. 127 — never both.

---

## 3. Flat-rate deduction for domestic help, care and assistance

**(Dependency / childcare-related extraordinary expenses)**

**Form wording**

> Flat-rate deduction from taxable income for extraordinary expenses relating to domestic help, care and assistance in cases of dependency and childcare costs

**What this is**
A forfait recognising **structural household burdens**, not luxury services.

**Typical expenses**

* Care at home for a dependent person
* Assistance due to dependency
* Certain non-ordinary childcare situations

**With a dependent child**

* Ordinary childcare (crèche, maison relais) → **NOT here** (that’s special expenses)
* Extraordinary care needs (medical, dependency-related) → **HERE**

**Legal basis**

* **Art. 127 LIR**
* **GD Regulation 19.12.2008**

**Key distinction**
Regular childcare = predictable → *not extraordinary*.

---

## 4. Extraordinary expenses for children not part of the household

**What this is**
Expenses incurred for **children who are not fiscally part of your household** (e.g. living abroad or with the other parent).

**Examples**

* Court-ordered support exceeding normal family benefits
* Exceptional medical or education expenses

**With your situation**

* You **do have** a dependent child *in* your household
* This item is therefore **normally NO**, unless you support *another* child elsewhere

**Legal basis**

* **Art. 127 LIR**

---

## Decision logic (compressed)

| Situation                                      | Relevant item                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Exceptional medical / care cost for your child | Art. 127 individual request          |
| Disabled child                                 | Disability forfait (1969 regulation) |
| Ordinary crèche / maison relais                | **Not extraordinary**                |
| Care due to dependency                         | 2008 forfait                         |
| Child lives with you                           | Excludes item 4                      |

---

## Bottom line (brutally honest)

* With **one healthy dependent child** → this section is **usually all “No”**.
* It only activates if life throws something **structurally abnormal** at you.

If you want, I can:

* classify **real-life expenses** you have (medical / childcare / care) into *special vs extraordinary*, or
* show how the tax office implicitly applies a **family-size-adjusted hardship threshold** under Art. 127.
