# ICAAP notes

<!-- more -->

At a very high level, there are two meta metrics. The pillar 1 capital ratio is the ratio between the availalbe CET1 capital and the risk weighted assets (RWA). The pillar 2 capital ratio is the ratio between the availalbe financial ressources (AFR) and the economic capital (ECAP). These two metrics summarize the capital adequacy of the bank from the normative perspective and the economic perspective. 
The ratios hide a lot of details, which we try to reveal below. 

## AFR


## ECAP
