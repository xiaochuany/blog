# ICAAP notes

<!-- more -->

At a very high level, there are two meta metrics. The pillar 1 capital ratio is the ratio between the availalbe CET1 capital and the risk weighted assets (RWA). The pillar 2 capital ratio is the ratio between the availalbe financial ressources (AFR) and the economic capital (ECAP). These two metrics form repectively the normative perspective and the economic perspective of the capital adequacy of the bank. 
Each of the four terms in two ratios deserves and should be carefully explained.
