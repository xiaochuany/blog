# unit root testing for autoregression

## first order AR model without intercept

$$
y_t = \rho y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
$$ 

null hypothesis: $\rho=1$

tests
- log likelihood ratio: $2 \log(L_1 - L0)$ asymptotically chi2 with degree 1 by Wilk's theorem
- OLS / quasi-MLE coincide: asymptotically Dickey-Fuller distribution (Brownian functional). 

the OLS limiting distribution works for general martingale difference errors. 

## AR(1) with intercept 

2 parameters 

- check the OLS for rho. does it converge to the same limit?
- are OLS and quasi-MLE the same?
- how about LR test? 

joint distriubtion convergence? 

## AR(p) 

can be turned in to VAR(1) by a vector formulation of the recursion. 

- are the errors in the vectoriezed formulation still martingale difference?

## VAR(1)

- how is the notion of unit root defined? 
- how does it generalize random walk? not just a partial sum of vectors. the matrix could be a rotation.   
- any VAR(p) can be turned into VAR(1) with a reparametrization. 
- estimation
- unit root test: DF test? 

## ADF 

the formulation invovles difference operator of the sequence and a trend component.

- is there a unified estimation framework
- any caveat when testing unit root in the presence of trend parameters
